Paper does not gives a fuck about legacy version users (moreover, they even consciously throws a monkey wrench into attemps to add support of modern java declining pull requests of ASM updates). It wouldn't be so bad if paper and mojang diarchy wouldn't break backward compatibility every version making migration so frustrating, so here's the fork.

Currently planned versions to maintain:
- 1.16.5

## What does "maintenance" here means?

Updating ASM so plugins on modern java will work. Probably other libraries that also required to be updated so version would be alive. No bugfixes, features, etc by me, but if you want to PR something, you can do anything you want while it is not breaking backward compatibility.
